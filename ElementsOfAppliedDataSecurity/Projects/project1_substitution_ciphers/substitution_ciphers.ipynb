      "rome's history spans 28 centuries. while roman mythology dates the founding of rome at around 753 bc, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for over three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in europe. the city's early population originated from a mix of latins, etruscans, and sabines. eventually, the city successively became the capital of the roman kingdom, the roman republic and the roman empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever imperial city and metropolis. it was first called the eternal city (latin: urbs aeterna; italian: la città eterna) by the roman poet tibullus in the 1st century bc, and the expression was also taken up by ovid, virgil, and livy. rome is also called caput mundi (capital of the world).\n",
      "after the fall of the empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the middle ages, rome slowly fell under the political control of the papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the papal states, which lasted until 1870. beginning with the renaissance, almost all popes since nicholas v (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world. in this way, rome first became one of the major centres of the renaissance and then became the birthplace of both the baroque style and neoclassicism. famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. in 1871, rome became the capital of the kingdom of italy, which, in 1946, became the italian republic.\n",
      "in 2019, rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited city in the european union, and the most popular tourist destination in italy. its historic centre is listed by unesco as a world heritage site. the host city for the 1960 summer olympics, rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the united nations, such as the food and agriculture organization (fao), the world food programme (wfp), the international fund for agricultural development (ifad) and the un system network on rural development and food security. the city also hosts the european union (eu) delegation to the united nations (un) and the secretariat of the parliamentary assembly of the union for the mediterranean (ufm) as well as the headquarters of several italian multinational companies, such as eni, enel, tim, leonardo, and banks such as bnl. numerous companies are based within rome's eur business district, such as the luxury fashion house fendi located in the palazzo della civiltà italiana. the presence of renowned international brands in the city has made rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the cinecittà studios have been the set of many academy award–winning movies.\n"

      "in april 2023, the united kingdom department for science, innovation & technology released a report on cyber attacks over the previous 12 months. they surveyed 2,263 uk businesses, 1,174 uk registered charities, and 554 education institutions. the research found that \"32% of businesses and 24% of charities overall recall any breaches or attacks from the last 12 months.\" these figures were much higher for \"medium businesses (59%), large businesses (69%), and high-income charities with £500,000 or more in annual income (56%).\" yet, although medium or large businesses are more often the victims, since larger companies have generally improved their security over the last decade, small and midsize businesses (smbs) have also become increasingly vulnerable as they often \"do not have advanced tools to defend the business.\" smbs are most likely to be affected by malware, ransomware, phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial-of service (dos) attacks.\n",
      "normal internet users are most likely to be affected by untargeted cyberattacks. these are where attackers indiscriminately target as many devices, services, or users as possible. they do this using techniques that take advantage of the openness of the internet. these strategies mostly include phishing, ransomware, water holing and scanning.\n",
      "to secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these threats can typically be classified into one of the following categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== backdoor ===\n",
      "a backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem, or an algorithm is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. these weaknesses may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. due to the nature of backdoors, they are of greater concern to companies and databases as opposed to individuals.\n",
      "backdoors may be added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access or by an attacker for malicious reasons. criminals often use malware to install backdoors, giving them remote administrative access to a system. once they have access, cybercriminals can \"modify files, steal personal information, install unwanted software, and even take control of the entire computer.\"\n",
      "backdoors can be very hard to detect and are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== denial-of-service attack ===\n",
      "denial-of-service attacks (dos) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. while a network attack from a single ip address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of distributed denial-of-service (ddos) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points. in this case, defending against these attacks is much more difficult. such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including distributed reflective denial-of-service (drdos), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim. with such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves. to understand why attackers may carry out these attacks, see the 'attacker motivation' section.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== physical access attacks ===\n",
      "\n",
      "a direct-access attack is when an unauthorized user (an attacker) gains physical access to a computer, most likely to directly copy data from it or steal information. attackers may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless microphones. even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a cd-rom or other bootable media. disk encryption and the trusted platform module standard are designed to prevent these attacks.\n",
      "direct service attackers are related in concept to direct memory attacks which allow an attacker to gain direct access to a computer's memory. the attacks \"take advantage of a feature of modern computers that allows certain devices, such as external hard drives, graphics cards, or network cards, to access the computer's memory directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== eavesdropping ===\n",
      "eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation (communication), usually between hosts on a network. it typically occurs when a user connects to a network where traffic is not secured or encrypted and sends sensitive business data to a colleague, which, when listened to by an attacker, could be exploited. data transmitted across an open network allows an attacker to exploit a vulnerability and intercept it via various methods.\n",
      "unlike malware, direct-access attacks, or other forms of cyber attacks, eavesdropping attacks are unlikely to negatively affect the performance of networks or devices, making them difficult to notice. in fact, \"the attacker does not need to have any ongoing connection to the software at all. the attacker can insert the software onto a compromised device, perhaps by direct insertion or perhaps by a virus or other malware, and then come back some time later to retrieve any data that is found or trigger the software to send the data at some determined time.\"\n",
      "using a virtual private network (vpn), which encrypts data between two points, is one of the most common forms of protection against eavesdropping. using the best form of encryption possible for wireless networks is best practice, as well as using https instead of an unencrypted http.\n",
      "programs such as carnivore and narusinsight have been used by the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) and nsa to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers. even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact with the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware. tempest is a specification by the nsa referring to these attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== malware ===\n",
      "malicious software (malware) is any software code or computer program \"intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users.\" once present on a computer, it can leak sensitive details such as personal information, business information and passwords, can give control of the system to the attacker, and can corrupt or delete data permanently. another type of malware is ransomware, which is when \"malware installs itself onto a victim's machine, encrypts their files, and then turns around and demands a ransom (usually in bitcoin) to return that data to the user.\"\n",
      "types of malware include some of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "viruses are a specific type of malware, and are normally a malicious code that hijacks software with the intention to \"do damage and spread copies of itself.\" copies are made with the aim to spread to other programs on a computer.\n",
      "worms are similar to viruses, however viruses can only function when a user runs (opens) a compromised program. worms are self-replicating malware that spread between programs, apps and devices without the need for human interaction.\n",
      "trojan horses are programs that pretend to be helpful or hide themselves within desired or legitimate software to \"trick users into installing them.\" once installed, a rat (remote access trojan) can create a secret backdoor on the affected device to cause damage.\n",
      "spyware is a type of malware that secretly gathers information from an infected computer and transmits the sensitive information back to the attacker. one of the most common forms of spyware are keyloggers, which record all of a user's keyboard inputs/keystrokes, to \"allow hackers to harvest usernames, passwords, bank account and credit card numbers.\"\n",
      "scareware, as the name suggests, is a form of malware which uses social engineering (manipulation) to scare, shock, trigger anxiety, or suggest the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying or installing unwanted software. these attacks often begin with a \"sudden pop-up with an urgent message, usually warning the user that they've broken the law or their device has a virus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== man-in-the-middle attacks ===\n",
      "man-in-the-middle attacks (mitm) involve a malicious attacker trying to intercept, surveil or modify communications between two parties by spoofing one or both party's identities and injecting themselves in-between. types of mitm attacks include:\n",
      "\n",
      "ip address spoofing is where the attacker hijacks routing protocols to reroute the targets traffic to a vulnerable network node for traffic interception or injection.\n",
      "message spoofing (via email, sms or ott messaging) is where the attacker spoofs the identity or carrier service while the target is using messaging protocols like email, sms or ott (ip-based) messaging apps. the attacker can then monitor conversations, launch social attacks or trigger zero-day-vulnerabilities to allow for further attacks.\n",
      "wifi ssid spoofing is where the attacker simulates a wifi base station ssid to capture and modify internet traffic and transactions. the attacker can also use local network addressing and reduced network defenses to penetrate the target's firewall by breaching known vulnerabilities. sometimes known as a pineapple attack thanks to a popular device. see also malicious association.\n",
      "dns spoofing is where attackers hijack domain name assignments to redirect traffic to systems under the attackers control, in order to surveil traffic or launch other attacks.\n",
      "ssl hijacking, typically coupled with another media-level mitm attack, is where the attacker spoofs the ssl authentication and encryption protocol by way of certificate authority injection in order to decrypt, surveil and modify traffic. see also tls interception\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== multi-vector, polymorphic attacks ===\n",
      "surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector, polymorphic cyber threats combine several types of attacks and change form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread.\n",
      "multi-vector polymorphic attacks, as the name describes, are both multi-vectored and polymorphic. firstly, they are a singular attack that involves multiple methods of attack. in this sense, they are \"multi-vectored (i.e. the attack can use multiple means of propagation such as via the web, email and applications.\" however,  they are also multi-staged, meaning that \"they can infiltrate networks and move laterally inside the network.\" the attacks can be polymorphic, meaning that the cyberattacks used such as viruses, worms or trojans \"constantly change (\"morph\") making it nearly impossible to detect them using signature-based defences.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== phishing ===\n",
      "\n",
      "phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users. phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing, instant messaging, text message, or on a phone call. they often direct users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. the fake website often asks for personal information, such as login details and passwords. this information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website.\n",
      "preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering. attackers can use creative ways to gain access to real accounts. a common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices to individuals showing that they recently purchased music, apps, or others, and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized. a more strategic type of phishing is spear-phishing which leverages personal or organization-specific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source. spear-phishing attacks target specific individuals, rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== privilege escalation ===\n",
      "privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. for example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system. the severity of attacks can range from attacks simply sending an unsolicited email to a ransomware attack on large amounts of data. privilege escalation usually starts with social engineering techniques, often phishing.\n",
      "privilege escalation can be separated into two strategies, horizontal and vertical privilege escalation:\n",
      "\n",
      "horizontal escalation (or account takeover) is where an attacker gains access to a normal user account that has relatively low-level privileges. this may be through stealing the user's username and password. once they have access, they have gained a foothold, and using this foothold the attacker then may move around the network of users at this same lower level, gaining access to information of this similar privilege.\n",
      "vertical escalation however targets people higher up in a company and often with more administrative power, such as an employee in it with a higher privilege. using this privileged account will then enable the attacker to invade other accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== side-channel attack ===\n",
      "\n",
      "any computational system affects its environment in some form. this effect it has on its environment can range from electromagnetic radiation, to residual effect on ram cells which as a consequence make a cold boot attack possible, to hardware implementation faults that allow for access or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible. in side-channel attack scenarios, the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure. the target information in a side channel can be challenging to detect due to its low amplitude when combined with other signals \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== social engineering ===\n",
      "social engineering, in the context of computer security, aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. or grant physical access by, for example, impersonating a senior executive, bank, a contractor, or a customer. this generally involves exploiting people's trust, and relying on their cognitive biases. a common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel, impersonating their ceo and urgently requesting some action. one of the main techniques of social engineering are phishing attacks.\n",
      "in early 2016, the fbi reported that such business email compromise (bec) scams had cost us businesses more than $2 billion in about two years.\n",
      "in may 2016, the milwaukee bucks nba team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president peter feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 w-2 tax forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== spoofing ===\n",
      "\n",
      "spoofing is an act of pretending to be a valid entity through the falsification of data (such as an ip address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain. spoofing is closely related to phishing. there are several types of spoofing, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "email spoofing, is where an attacker forges the sending (from, or source) address of an email.\n",
      "ip address spoofing, where an attacker alters the source ip address in a network packet to hide their identity or impersonate another computing system.\n",
      "mac spoofing, where an attacker modifies the media access control (mac) address of their network interface controller to obscure their identity, or to pose as another.\n",
      "biometric spoofing, where an attacker produces a fake biometric sample to pose as another user.\n",
      "address resolution protocol (arp) spoofing, where an attacker sends spoofed address resolution protocol onto a local area network to associate their media access control address with a different host's ip address. this causes data to be sent to the attacker rather than the intended host.\n",
      "in 2018, the cybersecurity firm trellix published research on the life-threatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== tampering ===\n",
      "tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data. it is an intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system, components of systems, its intended behavior, or data. so-called evil maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== html smuggling ===\n",
      "html smuggling allows an attacker to smuggle a malicious code inside a particular html or web page. html files can carry payloads concealed as benign, inert data in order to defeat content filters. these payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filter.\n",
      "when a target user opens the html, the malicious code is activated; the web browser then decodes the script, which then unleashes the malware onto the target's device.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== information security practices ==\n",
      "employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization. information security culture is the \"...totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds.\"\n",
      "andersson and reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization's information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes. indeed, the verizon data breach investigations report 2020, which examined 3,950 security breaches, discovered 30% of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company. research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. in \"information security culture from analysis to change\", authors commented, \"it's a never-ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" to manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "pre-evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze the current security policies.\n",
      "strategic planning: to come up with a better awareness program, clear targets need to be set. assembling a team of skilled professionals is helpful to achieve it.\n",
      "operative planning: a good security culture can be established based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness and a training program.\n",
      "implementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. they are:\n",
      "commitment of the management\n",
      "communication with organizational members\n",
      "courses for all organizational members\n",
      "commitment of the employees\n",
      "post-evaluation: to assess the success of the planning and implementation, and to identify unresolved areas of concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== computer protection (countermeasures) ==\n",
      "in computer security, a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.\n",
      "some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== security by design ===\n",
      "\n",
      "security by design, or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure. in this case, security is considered a main feature.\n",
      "the uk government's national cyber security centre separates secure cyber design principles into five sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "before a secure system is created or updated, companies should ensure they understand the fundamentals and the context around the system they are trying to create and identify any weaknesses in the system.\n",
      "companies should design and centre their security around techniques and defences which make attacking their data or systems inherently more challenging for attackers.\n",
      "companies should ensure that their core services that rely on technology are protected so that the systems are essentially never down.\n",
      "although systems can be created which are safe against a multitude of attacks, that does not mean that attacks will not be attempted. despite one's security, all companies' systems should aim to be able to detect and spot attacks as soon as they occur to ensure the most effective response to them.\n",
      "companies should create secure systems designed so that any attack that is successful has minimal severity.\n",
      "these design principles of security by design can include some of the following techniques:\n",
      "\n",
      "the principle of least privilege, where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. that way, even if an attacker gains access to that part, they only have limited access to the whole system.\n",
      "automated theorem proving to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.\n",
      "code reviews and unit testing, approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.\n",
      "defense in depth, where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.\n",
      "default secure settings, and design to fail secure rather than fail insecure (see fail-safe for the equivalent in safety engineering). ideally, a secure system should require a deliberate, conscious, knowledgeable and free decision on the part of legitimate authorities in order to make it insecure.\n",
      "audit trails track system activity so that when a security breach occurs, the mechanism and extent of the breach can be determined. storing audit trails remotely, where they can only be appended to, can keep intruders from covering their tracks.\n",
      "full disclosure of all vulnerabilities, to ensure that the window of vulnerability is kept as short as possible when bugs are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== security architecture ===\n",
      "security architecture can be defined as the \"practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals.\" these goals have overlap with the principles of \"security by design\" explored above, including to \"make initial compromise of the system difficult,\" and to \"limit the impact of any compromise.\" in practice, the role of a security architect would be to ensure the structure of a system reinforces the security of the system, and that new changes are safe and meet the security requirements of the organization.\n",
      "similarly, techopedia defines security architecture as \"a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. it also specifies when and where to apply security controls. the design process is generally reproducible.\" the key attributes of security architecture are:\n",
      "\n",
      "the relationship of different components and how they depend on each other.\n",
      "determination of controls based on risk assessment, good practices, finances, and legal matters.\n",
      "the standardization of controls.\n",
      "practicing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, it and security concerns in an organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== security measures ===\n",
      "a state of computer security is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. these processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "limiting the access of individuals using user account access controls and using cryptography can protect systems files and data, respectively.\n",
      "firewalls are by far the most common prevention systems from a network security perspective as they can (if properly configured) shield access to internal network services and block certain kinds of attacks through packet filtering. firewalls can be both hardware and software-based. firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic of a computer network and establish a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network.\n",
      "intrusion detection system (ids) products are designed to detect network attacks in-progress and assist in post-attack forensics, while audit trails and logs serve a similar function for individual systems.\n",
      "response is necessarily defined by the assessed security requirements of an individual system and may cover the range from simple upgrade of protections to notification of legal authorities, counter-attacks, and the like. in some special cases, the complete destruction of the compromised system is favored, as it may happen that not all the compromised resources are detected.\n",
      "cyber security awareness training to cope with cyber threats and attacks.\n",
      "forward web proxy solutions can prevent the client to visit malicious web pages and inspect the content before downloading to the client machines.\n",
      "today, computer security consists mainly of preventive measures, like firewalls or an exit procedure. a firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the internet. they can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the network stack (or, in the case of most unix-based operating systems such as linux, built into the operating system kernel) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. another implementation is a so-called physical firewall, which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the internet.\n",
      "some organizations are turning to big data platforms, such as apache hadoop, to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threats.\n",
      "in order to ensure adequate security, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a network, better known as the cia triad, must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security. to achieve those objectives, administrative, physical and technical security measures should be employed. the amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== vulnerability management ===\n",
      "\n",
      "vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities, especially in software and firmware. vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security.\n",
      "vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner, which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities, such as open ports, insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to malware.  in order for these tools to be effective, they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release.  typically, these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently.\n",
      "beyond vulnerability scanning, many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. in some sectors, this is a contractual requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== reducing vulnerabilities ===\n",
      "the act of assessing and reducing vulnerabilities to cyber attacks is commonly referred to as information technology security assessments. they aim to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities. while formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible, it is not yet common. operating systems formally verified include sel4, and sysgo's pikeos – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.\n",
      "it is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates and by hiring people with expertise in security. large companies with significant threats can hire security operations centre (soc) analysts. these are specialists in cyber defences, with their role ranging from \"conducting threat analysis to investigating reports of any new issues and preparing and testing disaster recovery plans.\"\n",
      "whilst no measures can completely guarantee the prevention of an attack, these measures can help mitigate the damage of possible attacks. the effects of data loss/damage can be also reduced by careful backing up and insurance.\n",
      "outside of formal assessments, there are various methods of reducing vulnerabilities. two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. it requires something you know: a password or pin, and something you have: a card, dongle, cellphone, or another piece of hardware. this increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.\n",
      "protecting against social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only happen by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. training is often involved to help mitigate this risk by improving people's knowledge of how to protect themselves and by increasing people's awareness of threats. however, even in highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.\n",
      "inoculation, derived from inoculation theory, seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks and traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== hardware protection mechanisms ===\n",
      "\n",
      "hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. using devices and methods such as dongles, trusted platform modules, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling usb ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated backdoor access) required in order to be compromised. each of these is covered in more detail below.\n",
      "\n",
      "usb dongles are typically used in software licensing schemes to unlock software capabilities, but they can also be seen as a way to prevent unauthorized access to a computer or other device's software. the dongle, or key, essentially creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the software application and the key. the principle is that an encryption scheme on the dongle, such as advanced encryption standard (aes) provides a stronger measure of security since it is harder to hack and replicate the dongle than to simply copy the native software to another machine and use it. another security application for dongles is to use them for accessing web-based content such as cloud software or virtual private networks (vpns). in addition, a usb dongle can be configured to lock or unlock a computer.\n",
      "trusted platform modules (tpms) secure devices by integrating cryptographic capabilities onto access devices, through the use of microprocessors, or so-called computers-on-a-chip. tpms used in conjunction with server-side software offer a way to detect and authenticate hardware devices, preventing unauthorized network and data access.\n",
      "computer case intrusion detection refers to a device, typically a push-button switch, which detects when a computer case is opened. the firmware or bios is programmed to show an alert to the operator when the computer is booted up the next time.\n",
      "drive locks are essentially software tools to encrypt hard drives, making them inaccessible to thieves. tools exist specifically for encrypting external drives as well.\n",
      "disabling usb ports is a security option for preventing unauthorized and malicious access to an otherwise secure computer. infected usb dongles connected to a network from a computer inside the firewall are considered by the magazine network world as the most common hardware threat facing computer networks.\n",
      "disconnecting or disabling peripheral devices (like camera, gps, removable storage, etc.), that are not in use.\n",
      "mobile-enabled access devices are growing in popularity due to the ubiquitous nature of cell phones. built-in capabilities such as bluetooth, the newer bluetooth low energy (le), near-field communication (nfc) on non-ios devices and biometric validation such as thumbprint readers, as well as qr code reader software designed for mobile devices, offer new, secure ways for mobile phones to connect to access control systems. these control systems provide computer security and can also be used for controlling access to secure buildings.\n",
      "iommus allow for hardware-based sandboxing of components in mobile and desktop computers by utilizing direct memory access protections.\n",

      "=== secure operating systems ===\n",
      "\n",
      "one use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems. using secure operating systems is a good way of ensuring computer security. these are systems that have achieved certification from an external security-auditing organization, the most popular evaluations are common criteria (cc).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== secure coding ===\n",
      "\n",
      "in software engineering, secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. it is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure. such systems are secure by design. beyond this, formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system;\n",
      "important for cryptographic protocols for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== capabilities and access control lists ===\n",
      "\n",
      "within computer systems, two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists (acls) and role-based access control (rbac).\n",
      "an access-control list (acl), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions associated with an object. an acl specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.\n",
      "role-based access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users,  used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees, and can implement mandatory access control (mac) or discretionary access control (dac).\n",
      "a further approach, capability-based security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems. capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. an open-source project in the area is the e language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== user security training ===\n",
      "the end-user is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain and it is estimated that more than 90% of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error. among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management, sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient, the inability to recognize misleading urls and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments.  a common mistake that users make is saving their user id/password in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites.  this is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means.  the risk may be mitigated by the use of two-factor authentication.\n",
      "as the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk an organization is facing, security awareness training, at all levels, not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats.\n",
      "the focus on the end-user represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners, who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective, and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization, recognizing that a security-aware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== digital hygiene ===\n",
      "related to end-user training, digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and, as the analogy with personal hygiene shows, is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats. the assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection, reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network, especially from common cyberattacks. cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence, a military term.\n",
      "the most common acts of digital hygiene can include updating malware protection, cloud back-ups, passwords, and ensuring restricted admin rights and network firewalls. as opposed to a purely technology-based defense against threats, cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline or education. it can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal or collective digital security. as such, these measures can be performed by laypeople, not just security experts.\n",
      "cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses (or pathogens). however, while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses, the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention, perhaps as late as 2000 by internet pioneer vint cerf. it has since been adopted by the congress and senate of the united states, the fbi, eu institutions and heads of state.\n",

      "=== difficulty of responding to breaches ===\n",
      "responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "identifying attackers is difficult, as they may operate through proxies, temporary anonymous dial-up accounts, wireless connections, and other anonymizing procedures which make back-tracing difficult – and are often located in another jurisdiction. if they successfully breach security, they have also often gained enough administrative access to enable them to delete logs to cover their tracks.\n",
      "the sheer number of attempted attacks, often by automated vulnerability scanners and computer worms, is so large that organizations cannot spend time pursuing each.\n",
      "law enforcement officers often lack the skills, interest or budget to pursue attackers. furthermore, identifying attackers across a network may necessitate collecting logs from multiple locations within the network and across various countries, a process that can be both difficult and time-consuming.\n",
      "where an attack succeeds and a breach occurs, many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws.\n",

      "the computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the u.s. securities and exchange commission, swift, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains. websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers, brokerage accounts, and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the black market. in-store payment systems and atms have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and pins.\n",
      "the ucla internet report: surveying the digital future (2000) found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card security.\n",
      "the most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named ssl (secure sockets layer), and its successor tls (transport layer security), identity management and authentication services, and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce. several versions of ssl and tls are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing, e-mail, internet faxing, instant messaging, and voip (voice-over-ip). there are various interoperable implementations of these technologies, including at least one implementation that is open source. open source allows anyone to view the application's source code, and look for and report vulnerabilities.\n",
      "the credit card companies visa and mastercard cooperated to develop the secure emv chip which is embedded in credit cards. further developments include the chip authentication program where banks give customers hand-held card readers to perform online secure transactions. other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as instant issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue on-the-spot credit cards to interested customers.\n",

      "the aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked. a simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide, much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted, and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore. there is also potential for attack from within an aircraft.\n",
      "implementing fixes in aerospace systems poses a unique challenge because efficient air transportation is heavily affected by weight and volume. improving security by adding physical devices to airplanes could increase their unloaded weight, and could potentially reduce cargo or passenger capacity.\n",
      "in europe, with the (pan-european network service) and newpens, and in the us with the nextgen program, air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks.\n",
      "many modern passports are now biometric passports, containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name, gender, and date of birth. in addition, more countries are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identity-related fraud. the introduction of the epassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder, thus allowing for quick passenger processing. plans are under way in the us, the uk, and australia to introduce smartgate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology. the airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets (e-tickets). these have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines. long-distance bus companies are also switching over to e-ticketing transactions today.\n",

      "simple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector, and the car's onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping. however, if access is gained to a car's internal controller area network, the danger is much greater – and in a widely publicized 2015 test, hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditch.\n",
      "manufacturers are reacting in numerous ways, with tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars' computer systems. in the area of autonomous vehicles, in september 2016 the united states department of transportation announced some initial safety standards, and called for states to come up with uniform policies.\n",

      "the internet of things (iot) is the network of physical objects such as devices, vehicles, and buildings that are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data. concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involved.\n",
      "while the iot creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,\n",
      "it also provides opportunities for misuse. in particular, as the internet of things spreads widely, cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. if a front door's lock is connected to the internet, and can be locked/unlocked from a phone, then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone. people could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by iot-enabled devices. thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent non-internet-connected hotel door locks.\n",

      "== cost and impact of security breaches ==\n",
      "serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches, but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. \"several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. the 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). the reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal.\"\n",
      "however, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. according to the classic gordon-loeb model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).\n",

      "\n",
      "== attacker motivation ==\n",
      "as with physical security, the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. some are thrill-seekers or vandals, some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. state-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as markus hess who hacked for the kgb, as recounted by clifford stoll in the cuckoo's egg.\n",
      "attackers motivations can vary for all types of attacks from pleasure to political goals. for example, hacktivists may target a company or organization that carries out activities they do not agree with. this would be to create bad publicity for the company by having its website crash.\n",
      "high capability hackers, often with larger backing or state sponsorship, may attack based on the demands of their financial backers. these attacks are more likely to attempt more serious attack. an example of a more serious attack was the 2015 ukraine power grid hack, which reportedly utilised the spear-phising, destruction of files, and denial-of-service attacks to carry out the full attack.\n",
      "additionally, recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas. the growth of the internet, mobile technologies, and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations. all critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors. several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preference.\n",
      "a key aspect of threat modeling for any system is identifying the motivations behind potential attacks and the individuals or groups likely to carry them out. the level and detail of security measures will differ based on the specific system being protected. for instance, a home personal computer, a bank, and a classified military network each face distinct threats, despite using similar underlying technologies.\n",

      "== computer security incident management ==\n",
      "computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. an incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure. the intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident, limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual. responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize losses.\n",
      "incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization's response to a cyberattack. without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organization's response and resolution.\n",

      "access authorization restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems. these systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive login screen, or individual services, such as a ftp server. there are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards, smart cards, and biometric systems.\n",
      "anti-virus software consists of computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware).\n",
      "applications are executable code, so general corporate practice is to restrict or block users the power to install them; to install them only when there is a demonstrated need (e.g. software needed to perform assignments); to install only those which are known to be reputable (preferably with access to the computer code used to create the application,- and to reduce the attack surface by installing as few as possible. they are typically run with least privilege, with a robust process in place to identify, test and install any released security patches or updates for them.\n",
      "for example, programs can be installed into an individual user's account, which limits the program's potential access, as well as being a means control which users have specific exceptions to policy.  in linux, freebsd, openbsd, and other unix-like operating systems there is an option to further restrict an application using chroot or other means of restricting the application to its own 'sandbox'.  for example. linux provides namespaces, and cgroups to further restrict the access of an application to system resources.\n",
      "generalized security frameworks such as selinux or apparmor help administrators control access.\n",
      "java and other languages which compile to java byte code and run in the java virtual machine can have their access to other applications controlled at the virtual machine level.\n",
      "some software can be run in software containers which can even provide their own set of system libraries, limiting the software's, or anyone controlling it, access to the server's versions of the libraries.\n",
      "authentication techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are.\n",
      "automated theorem proving and other verification tools can be used to enable critical algorithms and code used in secure systems to be mathematically proven to meet their specifications.\n",
      "backups are one or more copies kept of important computer files. typically, multiple copies will be kept at different locations so that if a copy is stolen or damaged, other copies will still exist.\n",
      "capability and access control list techniques can be used to ensure privilege separation and mandatory access control. capabilities vs. acls discusses their use.\n",
      "chain of trust techniques can be used to attempt to ensure that all software loaded has been certified as authentic by the system's designers.\n",

      "cyberwarfare is an internet-based conflict that involves politically motivated attacks on information and information systems. such attacks can, for example, disable official websites and networks, disrupt or disable essential services, steal or alter classified data, and cripple financial systems.\n",
      "data integrity is the accuracy and consistency of stored data, indicated by an absence of any alteration in data between two updates of a data record.\n",
      "\n",
      "encryption is used to protect the confidentiality of a message. cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible. symmetric-key ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys, and public-key encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance.\n",
      "endpoint security software aids networks in preventing malware infection and data theft at network entry points made vulnerable by the prevalence of potentially infected devices such as laptops, mobile devices, and usb drives.\n",
      "firewalls serve as a gatekeeper system between networks, allowing only traffic that matches defined rules. they often include detailed logging, and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features. they are near-universal between company local area networks and the internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured.\n",
      "a hacker is someone who seeks to breach defenses and exploit weaknesses in a computer system or network.\n",

      "== history ==\n",
      "since the internet's arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years, the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives. cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change. in the 1970s and 1980s, computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the internet, where, with increased connectivity, computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off. after the spread of viruses in the 1990s, the 2000s marked the institutionalization of organized attacks such as distributed denial of service. this led to the formalization of cybersecurity as a professional discipline.\n",
      "the april 1967 session organized by willis ware at the spring joint computer conference, and the later publication of the ware report, were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security. ware's work straddled the intersection of material, cultural, political, and social concerns.\n",
      "a 1977 nist publication introduced the cia triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals. while still relevant, many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposed.\n",
      "however, in the 1970s and 1980s, there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing, and security threats were easily identifiable. more often, threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files. although malware and network breaches existed during the early years, they did not use them for financial gain. by the second half of the 1970s, established computer firms like ibm started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software products.\n",
      "one of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm creeper written by bob thomas at bbn, which propagated through the arpanet in 1971. the program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload. a later program, reaper, was created by ray tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy creeper.\n",
      "between september 1986 and june 1987, a group of german hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage. the group hacked into american defense contractors, universities, and military base networks and sold gathered information to the soviet kgb. the group was led by markus hess, who was arrested on 29 june 1987. he was convicted of espionage (along with two co-conspirators) on 15 feb 1990.\n",
      "in 1988, one of the first computer worms, called the morris worm, was distributed via the internet. it gained significant mainstream media attention.\n",
      "netscape started developing the protocol ssl, shortly after the national center for supercomputing applications (ncsa) launched mosaic 1.0, the first web browser, in 1993. netscape had ssl version 1.0 ready in 1994, but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities. however, in 1995, netscape launched version 2.0.\n",
      "the national security agency (nsa) is responsible for the protection of u.s. information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence. the agency analyzes commonly used software and system configurations to find security flaws, which it can use for offensive purposes against competitors of the united states.\n",
      "nsa contractors created and sold click-and-shoot attack tools to us agencies and close allies, but eventually, the tools made their way to foreign adversaries. in 2016, nsas own hacking tools were hacked, and they have been used by russia and north korea. nsa's employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries, anxious to compete in cyberwarfare. in 2007, the united states and israel began exploiting security flaws in the microsoft windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in iran to refine nuclear materials. iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability, which it began using against the united states.\n",

      " in cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of plaintext are replaced with the ciphertext, in a defined manner, with the help of a key; the \"units\" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. the receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution process to extract the original message.\n",
      "substitution ciphers can be compared with transposition ciphers. in a transposition cipher, the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually zuite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. by contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sezuence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.\n",
      "there are a number of different types of substitution cipher. if the cipher operates on single letters, it is termed a simple substitution cipher; a cipher that operates on larger groups of letters is termed polygraphic. a monoalphabetic cipher uses fixed substitution over the entire message, whereas a polyalphabetic cipher uses a number of substitutions at different positions in the message, where a unit from the plaintext is mapped to one of several possibilities in the ciphertext and vice versa.\n",
      "the first ever published description of how to crack simple substitution ciphers was given by al-kindi in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages written around 850 ce. the method he described is now known as frezuency analysis.\n",

      "the substitution alphabet could also be scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a mixed alphabet or deranged alphabet. traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order.\n",

      "although the traditional keyword method for creating a mixed substitution alphabet is simple, a serious disadvantage is that the last letters of the alphabet (which are mostly low frezuency) tend to stay at the end. a stronger way of constructing a mixed alphabet is to generate the substitution alphabet completely randomly.\n",
      "although the number of possible substitution alphabets is very large (26! ≈ 288.4, or about 88 bits), this cipher is not very strong, and is easily broken. provided the message is of reasonable length (see below), the cryptanalyst can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by analyjing the frezuency distribution of the ciphertext. this allows formation of partial words, which can be tentatively filled in, progressively expanding the (partial) solution (see frezuency analysis for a demonstration of this). in some cases, underlying words can also be determined from the pattern of their letters; for example, the english words tater, ninth, and paper all have the pattern abacd. many people solve such ciphers for recreation, as with cryptogram pujjles in the newspaper.\n",

      "nomenclators were the standard fare of diplomatic correspondence, espionage, and advanced political conspiracy from the early fifteenth century to the late eighteenth century; most conspirators were and have remained less cryptographically sophisticated. although government intelligence cryptanalysts were systematically breaking nomenclators by the mid-sixteenth century, and superior systems had been available since 1467, the usual response to cryptanalysis was simply to make the tables larger. by the late eighteenth century, when the system was beginning to die out, some nomenclators had 50,000 symbols.\n",

      "an early attempt to increase the difficulty of frezuency analysis attacks on substitution ciphers was to disguise plaintext letter frezuencies by homophony. in these ciphers, plaintext letters map to more than one ciphertext symbol. usually, the highest-frezuency plaintext symbols are given more ezuivalents than lower frezuency letters. in this way, the frezuency distribution is flattened, making analysis more difficult.\n",
      "since more than 26 characters will be rezuired in the ciphertext alphabet, various solutions are employed to invent larger alphabets. perhaps the simplest is to use a numeric substitution 'alphabet'. another method consists of simple variations on the existing alphabet; uppercase, lowercase, upside down, etc. more artistically, though not necessarily more securely, some homophonic ciphers employed wholly invented alphabets of fanciful symbols.\n",
      "the book cipher is a type of homophonic cipher, one example being the beale ciphers. this is a story of buried treasure that was described in 1819–21 by use of a ciphered text that was keyed to the declaration of independence. here each ciphertext character was represented by a number.  the number was determined by taking the plaintext character and finding a word in the declaration of independence that started with that character and using the numerical position of that word in the declaration of independence as the encrypted form of that letter.  since many words in the declaration of independence start with the same letter, the encryption of that character could be any of the numbers associated with the words in the declaration of independence that start with that letter. deciphering the encrypted text character x (which is a number) is as simple as looking up the xth word of the declaration of independence and using the first letter of that word as the decrypted character.\n",
      "another homophonic cipher was described by stahl and was one of the first attempts to provide for computer security of data systems in computers through encryption. stahl constructed the cipher in such a way that the number of homophones for a given character was in proportion to the frezuency of the character, thus making frezuency analysis much more difficult.\n",

      "the work of al-zalzashandi (1355-1418), based on the earlier work of ibn al-durayhim (1312–1359), contained the first published discussion of the substitution and transposition of ciphers, as well as the first description of a polyalphabetic cipher, in which each plaintext letter is assigned more than one substitute. polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were later described in 1467 by leone battista alberti in the form of disks. qohannes trithemius, in his book steganographia (ancient greek for \"hidden writing\") introduced the now more standard form of a tableau (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). a more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by giovanni battista della porta in his book, de furtivis literarum notis (latin for \"on concealed characters in writing\").\n",
      "in a polyalphabetic cipher, multiple cipher alphabets are used. to facilitate encryption, all the alphabets are usually written out in a large table, traditionally called a tableau. the tableau is usually 26×26, so that 26 full ciphertext alphabets are available. the method of filling the tableau, and of choosing which alphabet to use next, defines the particular polyalphabetic cipher. all such ciphers are easier to break than once believed, as substitution alphabets are repeated for sufficiently large plaintexts.\n",
      "one of the most popular was that of blaise de vigenère. first published in 1585, it was considered unbreakable until 1863, and indeed was commonly called le chiffre indéchiffrable (french for \"indecipherable cipher\").\n",
      "in the vigenère cipher, the first row of the tableau is filled out with a copy of the plaintext alphabet, and successive rows are simply shifted one place to the left. (such a simple tableau is called a tabula recta, and mathematically corresponds to adding the plaintext and key letters, modulo 26.) a keyword is then used to choose which ciphertext alphabet to use. each letter of the keyword is used in turn, and then they are repeated again from the beginning. so if the keyword is 'cat', the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet 'c', the second under 'a', the third under 't', the fourth under 'c' again, and so on, or if the keyword is 'rise', the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet 'r', the second under 'i', the third under 's', the fourth under 'e', and so on. in practice, vigenère keys were often phrases several words long.\n",
      "in 1863, friedrich kasiski published a method (probably discovered secretly and independently before the crimean war by charles babbage) which enabled the calculation of the length of the keyword in a vigenère ciphered message. once this was done, ciphertext letters that had been enciphered under the same alphabet could be picked out and attacked separately as a number of semi-independent simple substitutions - complicated by the fact that within one alphabet letters were separated and did not form complete words, but simplified by the fact that usually a tabula recta had been employed.\n",
      "as such, even today a vigenère type cipher should theoretically be difficult to break if mixed alphabets are used in the tableau, if the keyword is random, and if the total length of ciphertext is less than 27.67 times the length of the keyword. these rezuirements are rarely understood in practice, and so vigenère enciphered message security is usually less than might have been.\n",

      "although the number of possible substitution alphabets is very large (26! ≈ 288.4, or about 88 bits), this cipher is not very strong, and is easily broken. provided the message is of reasonable length (see below), the cryptanalyst can deduce the probable meaning of the most common symbols by analyjing the frequency distribution of the ciphertext. this allows formation of partial words, which can be tentatively filled in, progressively expanding the (partial) solution (see frequency analysis for a demonstration of this). in some cases, underlying words can also be determined from the pattern of their letters; for example, the english words tater, ninth, and paper all have the pattern abacd. many people solve such ciphers for recreation, as with cryptogram pujjles in the newspaper.\n",
      "according to the unicity distance of english, 27.6 letters of ciphertext are required to crack a mixed alphabet simple substitution. in practice, typically about 50 letters are needed, although some messages can be broken with fewer if unusual patterns are found. in other cases, the plaintext can be contrived to have a nearly flat frequency distribution, and much longer plaintexts will then be required by the cryptanalyst.\n",

      "=== nomenclator ===\n",
      "\n",
      "one once-common variant of the substitution cipher is the nomenclator. named after the public official who announced the titles of visiting dignitaries, this cipher uses a small code sheet containing letter, syllable and word substitution tables, sometimes homophonic, that typically converted symbols into numbers. originally the code portion was restricted to the names of important people, hence the name of the cipher; in later years, it covered many common words and place names as well. the symbols for whole words (codewords in modern parlance) and letters (cipher in modern parlance) were not distinguished in the ciphertext. the rossignols' great cipher used by louis xiv of france was one.\n",
      "nomenclators were the standard fare of diplomatic correspondence, espionage, and advanced political conspiracy from the early fifteenth century to the late eighteenth century; most conspirators were and have remained less cryptographically sophisticated. although government intelligence cryptanalysts were systematically breaking nomenclators by the mid-sixteenth century, and superior systems had been available since 1467, the usual response to cryptanalysis was simply to make the tables larger. by the late eighteenth century, when the system was beginning to die out, some nomenclators had 50,000 symbols.\n",
      "nevertheless, not all nomenclators were broken; today, cryptanalysis of archived ciphertexts remains a fruitful area of historical research.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== homophonic ===\n",
      "an early attempt to increase the difficulty of frequency analysis attacks on substitution ciphers was to disguise plaintext letter frequencies by homophony. in these ciphers, plaintext letters map to more than one ciphertext symbol. usually, the highest-frequency plaintext symbols are given more equivalents than lower frequency letters. in this way, the frequency distribution is flattened, making analysis more difficult.\n",
      "since more than 26 characters will be required in the ciphertext alphabet, various solutions are employed to invent larger alphabets. perhaps the simplest is to use a numeric substitution 'alphabet'. another method consists of simple variations on the existing alphabet; uppercase, lowercase, upside down, etc. more artistically, though not necessarily more securely, some homophonic ciphers employed wholly invented alphabets of fanciful symbols.\n",
      "the book cipher is a type of homophonic cipher, one example being the beale ciphers. this is a story of buried treasure that was described in 1819–21 by use of a ciphered text that was keyed to the declaration of independence. here each ciphertext character was represented by a number.  the number was determined by taking the plaintext character and finding a word in the declaration of independence that started with that character and using the numerical position of that word in the declaration of independence as the encrypted form of that letter.  since many words in the declaration of independence start with the same letter, the encryption of that character could be any of the numbers associated with the words in the declaration of independence that start with that letter. deciphering the encrypted text character x (which is a number) is as simple as looking up the xth word of the declaration of independence and using the first letter of that word as the decrypted character.\n",
      "another homophonic cipher was described by stahl and was one of the first attempts to provide for computer security of data systems in computers through encryption. stahl constructed the cipher in such a way that the number of homophones for a given character was in proportion to the frequency of the character, thus making frequency analysis much more difficult.\n",
      "francesco i gonjaga, duke of mantua, used the earliest known example of a homophonic substitution cipher in 1401 for correspondence with one simone de crema.\n",
      "mary, queen of scots, while imprisoned by elijabeth i, during the years from 1578 to 1584 used homophonic ciphers with additional encryption using a nomenclator for frequent prefixes, suffixes, and proper names while communicating with her allies including michel de castelnau.\n",

      "=== polyalphabetic ===\n",
      "\n",
      "the work of al-qalqashandi (1355-1418), based on the earlier work of ibn al-durayhim (1312–1359), contained the first published discussion of the substitution and transposition of ciphers, as well as the first description of a polyalphabetic cipher, in which each plaintext letter is assigned more than one substitute. polyalphabetic substitution ciphers were later described in 1467 by leone battista alberti in the form of disks. zohannes trithemius, in his book steganographia (ancient greek for \"hidden writing\") introduced the now more standard form of a tableau (see below; ca. 1500 but not published until much later). a more sophisticated version using mixed alphabets was described in 1563 by giovanni battista della porta in his book, de furtivis literarum notis (latin for \"on concealed characters in writing\").\n",
      "in a polyalphabetic cipher, multiple cipher alphabets are used. to facilitate encryption, all the alphabets are usually written out in a large table, traditionally called a tableau. the tableau is usually 26×26, so that 26 full ciphertext alphabets are available. the method of filling the tableau, and of choosing which alphabet to use next, defines the particular polyalphabetic cipher. all such ciphers are easier to break than once believed, as substitution alphabets are repeated for sufficiently large plaintexts.\n",
      "one of the most popular was that of blaise de vigenère. first published in 1585, it was considered unbreakable until 1863, and indeed was commonly called le chiffre indéchiffrable (french for \"indecipherable cipher\").\n",
      "in the vigenère cipher, the first row of the tableau is filled out with a copy of the plaintext alphabet, and successive rows are simply shifted one place to the left. (such a simple tableau is called a tabula recta, and mathematically corresponds to adding the plaintext and key letters, modulo 26.) a keyword is then used to choose which ciphertext alphabet to use. each letter of the keyword is used in turn, and then they are repeated again from the beginning. so if the keyword is 'cat', the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet 'c', the second under 'a', the third under 't', the fourth under 'c' again, and so on, or if the keyword is 'rise', the first letter of plaintext is enciphered under alphabet 'r', the second under 'i', the third under 's', the fourth under 'e', and so on. in practice, vigenère keys were often phrases several words long.\n",
      "in 1863, friedrich kasiski published a method (probably discovered secretly and independently before the crimean war by charles babbage) which enabled the calculation of the length of the keyword in a vigenère ciphered message. once this was done, ciphertext letters that had been enciphered under the same alphabet could be picked out and attacked separately as a number of semi-independent simple substitutions - complicated by the fact that within one alphabet letters were separated and did not form complete words, but simplified by the fact that usually a tabula recta had been employed.\n",
      "as such, even today a vigenère type cipher should theoretically be difficult to break if mixed alphabets are used in the tableau, if the keyword is random, and if the total length of ciphertext is less than 27.67 times the length of the keyword. these requirements are rarely understood in practice, and so vigenère enciphered message security is usually less than might have been.\n",
      "other notable polyalphabetics include:\n",
      "\n",
      "the gronsfeld cipher. this is identical to the vigenère except that only 10 alphabets are used, and so the \"keyword\" is numerical.\n",
      "the beaufort cipher. this is practically the same as the vigenère, except the tabula recta is replaced by a backwards one, mathematically equivalent to ciphertext = key - plaintext. this operation is self-inverse, whereby the same table is used for both encryption and decryption.\n",
      "the autokey cipher, which mixes plaintext with a key to avoid periodicity.\n",
      "the running key cipher, where the key is made very long by using a passage from a book or similar text.\n",
      "modern stream ciphers can also be seen, from a sufficiently abstract perspective, to be a form of polyalphabetic cipher in which all the effort has gone into making the keystream as long and unpredictable as possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== polygraphic ===\n",
      "in a polygraphic substitution cipher, plaintext letters are substituted in larger groups, instead of substituting letters individually. the first advantage is that the frequency distribution is much flatter than that of individual letters (though not actually flat in real languages; for example, 'os' is much more common than 'rñ' in spanish). second, the larger number of symbols requires correspondingly more ciphertext to productively analyje letter frequencies.\n",

      "the earliest practical digraphic cipher (pairwise substitution), was the so-called playfair cipher, invented by sir charles wheatstone in 1854. in this cipher, a 5 x 5 grid is filled with the letters of a mixed alphabet (two letters, usually i and z, are combined). a digraphic substitution is then simulated by taking pairs of letters as two corners of a rectangle, and using the other two corners as the ciphertext (see the playfair cipher main article for a diagram). special rules handle double letters and pairs falling in the same row or column. playfair was in military use from the boer war through world war ii.\n",

      "the hill cipher, invented in 1929 by lester s. hill, is a polygraphic substitution which can combine much larger groups of letters simultaneously using linear algebra. each letter is treated as a digit in base 26: a = 0, b =1, and so on. (in a variation, 3 extra symbols are added to make the basis prime.) a block of n letters is then considered as a vector of n dimensions, and multiplied by a n x n matrix, modulo 26. the components of the matrix are the key, and should be random provided that the matrix is invertible in \n",

      "all of these were similar in that the substituted letter was chosen electrically from amongst the huge number of possible combinations resulting from the rotation of several letter disks. since one or more of the disks rotated mechanically with each plaintext letter enciphered, the number of alphabets used was astronomical. early versions of these machine were, nevertheless, breakable. william f. friedman of the us army's sis early found vulnerabilities in hebern's rotor machine, and gc&cs's dillwyn knox solved versions of the enigma machine (those without the \"plugboard\") well before wwii began. traffic protected by essentially all of the german military enigmas was broken by allied cryptanalysts, most notably those at bletchley park, beginning with the german army variant used in the early 1930s. this version was broken by inspired mathematical insight by marian rezewski in poland.\n",

      "the one-time pad is, in most cases, impractical as it requires that the key material be as long as the plaintext, actually random, used once and only once, and kept entirely secret from all except the sender and intended receiver. when these conditions are violated, even marginally, the one-time pad is no longer unbreakable. soviet one-time pad messages sent from the us for a brief time during world war ii used non-random key material. us cryptanalysts, beginning in the late 40s, were able to, entirely or partially, break a few thousand messages out of several hundred thousand.

      "the cipher's primary weakness comes from the fact that if the cryptanalyst can discover (by means of frequency analysis, brute force, guessing or otherwise) the plaintext of two ciphertext characters then the key can be obtained by solving a simultaneous equation. since we know a and m are relatively prime this can be used to rapidly discard many \"false\" keys in an automated system.\n",
